# 🔄 How WhatsApp Integration Works in Production

## 📋 Answers to Your Questions

### ❓ How does WhatsApp integration work?

**Connection Architecture:**
```
WhatsApp Web ←→ Puppeteer ←→ Node.js Bridge ←→ Python Backend
     ↓
Local sessions (files)
```

**1. Persistent Connection (not reactive!):**
- WhatsApp clients connect when the system starts and work continuously
- Messages are received in real-time via webhooks
- No need to connect each time for digest generation

### ❓ What happens when the container restarts?

**✅ SOLUTION: Automatic Connection Recovery**

1. **Session Persistence:**
   - WhatsApp Web sessions are saved to files (`/app/whatsapp_sessions/`)
   - Docker volume is mounted for data persistence
   - Sessions survive container restarts

2. **Automatic Reconnection:**
   ```javascript
   // When system starts
   async restoreAllClients() {
       // Load list of users with saved sessions
       for (user with saved session) {
           await this.initializeClientWithReconnect(userId);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Connection Monitoring:**
   - System checks status of all connections every 5 minutes
   - Automatically reconnects when disconnection is detected
   - Telegram notifications about connection status

### ❓ When does WhatsApp connection happen?

**NOT during digest generation!** Connection happens:

1. **When system starts** - automatic restoration of all sessions
2. **When adding new user** - initial connection
3. **When connection breaks** - automatic reconnection

**Digest generation** only reads already accumulated messages from the database.

## 🔧 Enhanced Architecture for Production

### 1. Persistent WhatsApp Bridge (`persistent_bridge.js`)
```javascript
class PersistentWhatsAppBridge {
    constructor() {
        this.clients = new Map();           // Active clients
        this.clientStates = new Map();      // Connection states
        this.reconnectIntervals = new Map(); // Reconnection intervals
    }

    async restoreAllClients() {
        // Auto-restoration on startup
    }

    startAutoReconnect() {
        // Monitoring every 5 minutes
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- State persistence in `client_states.json`
- Automatic reconnection on disconnection
- Real-time webhooks for new messages
- Graceful shutdown with state preservation

### 2. WhatsApp Webhooks (`whatsapp_webhooks.py`)
```python
@router.post("/webhook/whatsapp/message")
async def receive_whatsapp_message():
    # Receive message in real-time
    # Analyze importance via OpenAI (in background)
    # Save to DB for future digests
    # Urgent notifications for critical messages
```

**Message Processing Flow:**
```
WhatsApp → Node.js Bridge → Python Webhook → DB → (Digest on schedule)
                                         ↓
                            Urgent notifications (importance ≥5)
```

### 3. Updated Database Models
Added new fields for state tracking:
- `whatsapp_last_seen` - last activity
